# Localist 

Localist is a platform for users to create custom experiences or tours of their home town/city.  Everyone can be a guide, and everyone can have their hand in the tourism industry.

## Installation

Node.js must be installed on the device, as well the the node package manager; npm.

In a directory where you want to save this project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Team-24/localist.git
cd localist/localist-backend
npm install 
sails lift
```
In another terminal:
```bash
cd path/to/project/localist/localist-frontend
npm install 
npm run serve
```

Now, the development server for the front end will be running on localhost:8080 (by default), and the node.js server will be running on localhost:1337.
